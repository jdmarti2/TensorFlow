# Learning TensorFlow Through Coursera

If you are a software developer who wants to build scalable AI-powered algorithms, you need to understand how to use the tools to build them. 
These assginments are from a course that is part of the Machine Learning in Tensorflow Specialization. It taught me you best practices for using
TensorFlow, a popular open-source framework for machine learning.

In this course deeplearning.ai TensorFlow Specialization, I learn advanced techniques to improve the computer vision model I built in the previous assignment. 
I explored how to work with real-world images in different shapes and sizes, visualized the journey of an image through convolutions to understand how a
computer “sees” information, plot loss and accuracy, and explore strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropout.
